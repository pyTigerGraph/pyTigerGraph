For this module to work, you will have to install the Pandas module, by running pip install pandas . Take a look here for some demos displaying some of the functionality. getVertexDataframe getVertexDataframe(vertexType, select=\"\", where=\"\", limit=\"\", sort=\"\", timeout=0) Returns the verticies of a given vertex type that conform to the various arguments. Arguments: vertexType : Type of vertex desired select : Comma separated list of vertex attributes to be retrieved or omitted. Details where : Comma separated list of conditions that are all applied on each vertex' attributes. The conditions are in logical conjunction (i.e. they are \"AND'ed\" together). Details limit : Maximum number of vertex instances to be returned (after sorting). Details sort : Comma separated list of attributes the results should be sorted by. Details timeout : Time allowed for successful execution (0 = no limit, default). getVertexDataframeByID getVertexDataframeByID(vertexType, vertexIds) Retrieves vertices of the given vertex type, identified by their ID. Arguments: - vertexType : Type of vertex desired - vertexIds : A list of vertex IDs. upsertVertexDataFrame upsertVertexDataframe(df, vertexType, v_id=None, attributes=None) Upserts vertices from a Pandas DataFrame. Arguments: - df : The DataFrame to upsert. - vertexType : The type of vertex to upsert data to. - v_id : The field name where the vertex primary id is given. If omitted the dataframe index will be used instead. - attributes : A dictionary in the form of {target: source} where source is the column name in the dataframe and target is the attribute name in the graph vertex. When omitted all columns would be upserted with their current names. In this case column names must match the vertex's attribute names. vertexSetToDataFrame vertexSetToDataFrame(vertexSet, withId=True, withType=False) Converts a vertex set to Pandas DataFrame. Arguments: - vertexSet : A vertex set (a list of vertices of the same vertex type). - withId : Add a column with vertex IDs to the DataFrame. - withType : Add a column with vertex type to the DataFrame. Vertex sets are used for both the input and output of SELECT statements. They contain instances of vertices of the same type. For each vertex instance the vertex ID, the vertex type and the (optional) attributes are present (under v_id , v_type and attributes keys, respectively). See example in edgeSetToDataFrame . A vertex set has this structure: [ { \"v_id\": <vertex_id>, \"v_type\": <vertex_type_name>, \"attributes\": { \"attr1\": <value1>, \"attr2\": <value2>, \u22ee } }, \u22ee ] See: https://docs.tigergraph.com/dev/gsql-ref/querying/declaration-and-assignment-statements#vertex-set-variable-declaration-and-assignment getEdgesDataframe getEdgesDataframe(sourceVertexType, sourceVerticies, edgeType=None, targetVertexType=None, targetVertexId=None, select=\"\", where=\"\", limit=\"\", sort=\"\", timeout=0) Retrieves edges of the given edge type originating from the list of source verticies. Only sourceVertexType and sourceVerticies are required. If targetVertexId is specified, then targetVertexType must also be specified. If targetVertexType is specified, then edgeType must also be specified. Arguments: select : Comma separated list of edge attributes to be retrieved or omitted.

When omitted all columns would be upserted with their current names. In this case column names must match the vertex's attribute names. edgeSetToDataFrame edgeSetToDataFrame(self, edgeSet, withId=True, withType=False) Converts an edge set to Pandas DataFrame. Arguments: - edgeSet : An edge set (a list of edges of the same edge type). - withId : Add a column with edge IDs to the DataFrame. - Note: As edges do not have internal ID, this column will contain a generated composite ID, a combination of source and target vertex types and IDs (specifically: [<source vertex type>, <source vertex ID>, <target vertex type>, <target vertex ID>] ). This is unique within the vertex type, but not guaranteed to be globally (i.e. within the whole graph) unique. To get a globally unique edge id, the edge type needs to be added to the above combination (see withType below). - withType : Add a column with edge type to the DataFrame. - Note: The value of this column should be combined with the value of ID column to get a globally unique edge ID. Edge sets contain instances of the same edge type. Edge sets are not generated \"naturally\" like vertex sets, you need to collect edges in (global) accumulators, e.g. in case you want to visualise them in GraphStudio or by other tools.

This enables you to execute operations that are currently not available through REST API endpoints. The client is implemented in Java and distributed as a .jar archive. The client is downloaded on demand to the machine running your pyTigerGraph application; so you need to ensure that your code can access the download location and can save the .jar file locally. Furthermore, Java 8+ JRE must be installed and accessible on the machine. The .jar file is downloaded only if it's not yet available locally, i.e. it is downloaded only once for each database version accessed. Thus, you will potentially have multiple versions of the .jar file downloaded. The name pattern of the .jar file is gsql_client-x.y.z.jar , e.g. gsql_client-2.6.2.jar or gsql_client-3.0.0.jar . The default location where the .jar file is saved locally is ~/.gsql (which on Windows is \\Users\\<username>\\.gsql ). This can be changed using the initGsql() function's jarLocation parameter. The initGsql() needs to be called before any function that depends on the GSQL functionality (e.g. gsql() and getSchema() ) is invoked. Generally, the version of the database and the GSQL client must match. pyTigerGraph can query the version number of the database, and requests the appropriate client from the download location. In rare cases (when the changes/fixes do not impact the GSQL functionality) no new GSQL client version is released when a new version of the database is shipped. In these cases an appropriate GSQL client version needs to be manually specified via the gsqlVersion parameter (typically the latest available version that is lesser than the database version). You can check the list of available GSQL clients at the download location . NOTE: The intention is to replace the current functionality that uses the GSQL client with one that natively (i.e. using Python code only) communicates with the database. This is a short term plan, so look for changes in this are when you upgrade pyTgigerGraph (altough backward compatibility will be maintained). First, you will need to create a TigerGraphConnection . You can then initialize and test your connection by issuing any GSQL command like: print(conn.gsql('ls', options=[])) See the GSQL101 notebook for more examples. gsql conn.gsql(query, options=None) Runs a GSQL query and processes the output. Arguments: - query : The text of the query to run as one string. - options : A list of strings that will be passed as options the the GSQL client.

Notes : - If REST++ authentication is not enabled, then you do not need to provide a token (if you do, it will be ignored) and the functions below will raise exception. - You might not have the privilege to create secrets and thus you might need to request one first from the administrator of the TigerGraph instance. - Some pyTigerGraph functions communicate with the database through GraphStudio endpoints that use username/password based authentication, so you need to provide these independently from the token when you establish the connection to the database.

Data is upserted: - If vertex is not yet present in graph, it will be created. - If it's already in the graph, its attributes are updated with the values specified in the request. An optional operator controls how the attributes are updated. The attributes argument is expected to be a dictionary in this format: {<attribute_name>, <attribute_value>|(<attribute_name>, <operator>), \u2026} Example: {\"name\": \"Thorin\", \"points\": (10, \"+\"), \"bestScore\": (67, \"max\")} Returns a single number of accepted (successfully upserted) vertices (0 or 1).
